# ACME Corporation

Exercise from the book *Hugo in Action - Static sites and dynamic Jamstack apps* by Atishay Jain.

It is currently (25/09/2021) still a MEAP, *Manning Early Access Program*, and at version 12.

Create the site:

```bash
hugo new site acme_corp --format yaml
```

**YAML**: YAML Ain't Markup Language

**TOML**: Tom's Obvious Minimal Language

**!!!**: The items in the numbered list at the beginning of chapter 2.2 all have the number 1.

**!!!**: Exercise 2.5 should be moved from before chapter 2.3.1 to before chapter 2.3

**!!!**: The items in the numbered list in chapter 2.4.2 all have the number 1.

I am not interested in **Netlify** hosting (chapter 2.4.1) and after reading chapter 2.4.2 on **GitHub** Pages twice I still have no idea how to do it.
